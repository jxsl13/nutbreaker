# nutbreaker [WIP]

```text
nutbreaker, because want to break those hard VPN nuts.
```

This is a port of my [goripr](https://github.com/jxsl13/goripr) project that uses Redis to stpre IP ranges.
This project uses the embedded database [nutsdb](https://github.com/nutsdb/nutsdb) which is inspired by Redis but does not require a separete application to run.
